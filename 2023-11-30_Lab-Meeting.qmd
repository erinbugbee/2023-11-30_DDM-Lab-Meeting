# Interning as an Applied Scientist at Amazon

## Machine Learning University (MLU)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
Teach machine learning theory and practice by making ML education accessible. MLU provides anybody, anywhere, at any time access to the same machine learning courses used to train Amazon's own developers on machine learning.

## Content

-   Internal instructor-led courses, workshops, and ML Challenges

-   External YouTube courses with GitHub materials and MLU-Explain Articles

-   Educator Enablement Program

    -   Free program for helping community colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) teach AI/ML

## MLU-Explain Articles

-   Development Tools

    -   Svelte

        -   Open-source framework to create web applications

        -   .svelte files for components

            -   Includes Javascript, HTML, CSS for that component

        -   Compiles components, converts into efficient Javascript to create the web application

    -   D3.js

        -   Javascript library for manipulating and visualizing data in the web browser

## Sources of Bias and Bias Mitigation

![](images/bias.png)

-   For example, the world is biased because people are biased from their limited cognitive capacity --\> heuristics and biases

-   Techniques to mitigate bias at each phase in the ML lifecycle (pre-processing, model training, post-processing, post-deployment, full modeling process)
